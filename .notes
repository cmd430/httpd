== TODOs ==
  support custom directory listing pages
  support custom log format
  support custom error pages
  support all common HTTP/1.1 methods
  support .htaccess rules
  support plugins/modules
  support HTTP/2
  support SSL (https)
  better more flexible config (multi server support for example) - Linked List maybe for setting storage
  make sure i send all correct headers (probably make a function that does generic headers in one call)
  deamonize process, disable or enable from cmdline param - https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/02/c-daemon-process/

== IDEAS ==
  look into speeding up `void serve_cgi(int, http_request*)` by removing `fork()` if possible, maybe using another thread?
